'''
In this exercise, you have to reverse a list in O(N) linear time complexity and we want the algorithm to be in-place as well - so the algorithm can not use additional memory 
(it means you have to manipulate the input list and not create an independent list)!
For example: input is [1,2,3,4,5] then the output is [5,4,3,2,1]
