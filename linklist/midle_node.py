'''Suppose we have a standard linked list. Construct an in-place (without extra memory) algorithm that is able to find the middle node - and return with the middle node!

Note: you should construct an O(N) linear running time algorithm

For example: [1, 2, 3, 4] --> middle node is: 2,   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] --> middle node is: 3'''
